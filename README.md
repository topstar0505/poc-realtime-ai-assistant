# Realtime o1 assistant

## Improvements
> Up for the challenge? Here are some ideas on how to improve the experience:

- Add interruption handling. Current version prevents it for simplicity.
- ?Let tools run in parallel.
- Remove duplicate response bug. (Not sure if this is the api or a bug in the code)
