# Assistant Memory and Directory Management
> Feature specification for adding memory and directory management to the assistant.

## Memory
- We need to be able to save and load data from our tool calls and then reuse them in other tool calls.
- We'll use a JSON file to store the memory.

### Potential implementations

#### 1. Use a global variable
- This is the simplest implementation.
- We'll have to be careful to not overwrite the memory with a regular tool call.

#### 2. Use a JSON file
- This is good for simple session usage but large files will slow down the assistant.
- Now whenever the program loads or we modify the memory file, we'll reload the memory into a variable to be used in props that use it.

#### 3. Use a SQLite database
- This is great for arbitrary data storage, querying and cross session usage.
- Example table:
  - id
  - created_at
  - session_id
  - lookup_key - important, autogenerated this lets the assistant retrieve it later
  - context_name?
  - tool_name
  - tool_params
  - prompts[]
  - responses[]
  - final_response
